## Description

  *The what, why, and how:*

  In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a command-line application that allows the user to:
      * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

Bonus points if you're able to:

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department

  I complete this task using mySQL, Inquirer, and the console.table in order to print rows to the console. I also used SQL JOINS in order to make this a functional application.
